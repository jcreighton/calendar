## Architecture
- React
- CSS Modules
- ES6
- Karma + Mocha + Expect
- moment
- moment-range (https://github.com/gf3/moment-range)


## Instructions
- npm install
- npm run start
- npm run test


## What I Didn't Get To
- Handling more than 2 overlapping events
- Fake async API
- Testing all components
- Production build
- Real tests - I threw up some basic (re: sort of useless) tests. Normally, I use expect-jsx but for some reason, it's throwing an error & I didn't have the time to debug it or scrape it for better testing.
